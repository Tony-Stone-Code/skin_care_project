The Pitch: A "Digital Assistant" for Skin Care
Imagine you wake up with a strange, itchy rash. You don't want to queue for hours at a hospital, so you go to your local pharmacy. The pharmacist wants to help, but they aren't a skin specialist.

DermaTech Ghana is a smart tool designed to bridge that gap. It is a web app that helps pharmacists figure out what is wrong with your skin and recommends the right product that is actually sitting on their shelf.

How It Works (The 3-Step Process)
The Snap: The patient or pharmacist takes a close-up photo of the skin condition using a phone.

The Brain: Our software analyzes the photo. It doesn't just "guess"; it compares the photo against thousands of medical examples to identify the problem (like Ringworm, Eczema, or Acne).

The Match: The system acts like a safety checker. It looks up the official Ghanaian medical guidelines to see what medicine is safe to use. Then, it tells the pharmacist: "This looks like Eczema. You have Hydrocort Cream by M&G in stock that will help."

Why Is This Special? (The 2 Big Problems We Solve)
Most "AI" technology today has two major flaws that we are fixing:

1. The "Skin Color" Problem Most medical AI was built in the West using photos of white skin. Because of this, those apps often fail to see redness or inflammation on darker skin tones, leading to bad advice for Africans.

Our Solution: We are building our system specifically to be an expert on Ghanaian skin tones. It is trained to recognize how skin conditions look on us.

2. The "Unavailable Product" Problem If you use a generic health app, it might tell you to buy a brand of cream that is only sold in New York or London. That is useless to a patient in Accra.

Our Solution: Our system knows the local market. It recommends brands you know and trust (like Letap, M&G, or Tobinco) that are available in West African pharmacies right now.

Is It Safe?
Yes. The system is designed to be a "Triage Tool," not a Doctor.

Think of it like a smart traffic light.

Green Light: "This looks like mild acne. Here is a face wash."

Red Light: "This looks serious (perhaps an infection). Do not treat this at the pharmacy. Please send the patient to a doctor immediately."

Summary
We are building a tool that makes expert skin care faster, safer, and fairer for Ghanaians, right at their neighborhood pharmacy.
